# 2D Platformer 
A simple 2D platformer exercise to get familiar with the Unreal Engine environement featured in the follow tutorial by Cobra Code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g31NTpq9p-o&t=1143s.Outside of the tutorial, I added virtual controls so that the game can be used on an android device, as well as a rumble feature everytime the character jumps.

This project features movement left and right, jumping with sound effect, background music, parallax scrolling effect on the background and a simple stage with barriers to test player movement. 

Visual assets featured in this project can be found in the SunnyLand asset pack by Ansimuz (https://ansimuz.itch.io/sunny-land-pixel-game-art)
